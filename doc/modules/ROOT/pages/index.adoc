= Getting Started with Hibernate Second-Level Cache and Hazelcast with JCache

This guide will show you how to use Hazelcast IMDG as Hibernate's Second-Level Cache by leveraging Hibernate's https://www.javadoc.io/doc/javax.cache/cache-api/1.1.1[JCache (JSR 107)] support.

You will have a chance to see how to integrate Hazelcast with Hibernate without using the `hazelcast-hibernate` integration.

== What Youâ€™ll Learn

- How to use Hazelcast's distributed maps as entity/collection/query caches

== Prerequisites

- JDK 8+
- Apache Maven 3.2+

== Required Dependencies

First, we need to add required dependencies.

Let's include `hibernate-jcache` and `hibernate-core` dependencies. Keep in mind that both should have the same version:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-jcache</artifactId>
    <version>${hibernate-core.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

Make sure to include the `hazelcast` dependency as well:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.hazelcast</groupId>
    <artifactId>hazelcast</artifactId>
    <version>${hazelcast.version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== Configuring Hibernate JCache RegionFactory

Now we need to tell Hibernate to use JCache's region factory.

For Hibernate 5.2.x, you need to add a full class name:
[source, xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">
   org.hibernate.cache.jcache.JCacheRegionFactory
</property>
----


For Hibernate 5.3.x+, it's enough to mention _jcache_:
[source, xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class">
   jcache
</property>
----

== Configuring the Cache Provider

You can choose to either use an embedded Hazelcast instance, or connect to an external server using Hazelcast Client.

****
`EMBEDDED`: For creating an embedded Hazelcast instance with an application. This instance cannot be scaled up or
down unless you run or shutdown another Hibernate application with the same server config.

`CLIENT`: For connecting to an existing Hazelcast cluster that can scale up or down independently from your app.

- You can learn more about the differences between client and embedded topologies https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/#hazelcast-topology[here.]
****


Now let's configure the provider.

To use native client:

[source, xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.provider">
   com.hazelcast.client.cache.impl.HazelcastClientCachingProvider
</property>
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.uri">
   hazelcast-client.xml
</property>
----

To use embedded Hazelcast:

[source, xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.provider">
   com.hazelcast.cache.impl.HazelcastServerCachingProvider
</property>
<property name="hibernate.javax.cache.uri">
   hazelcast.xml
</property>
----


== Cache Configuration

Configure the cache via `hazelcast.xml` and the `<cache>` part:

[source, xml]
----
<cache name="custom.cache.region.name">
    <statistics-enabled>true</statistics-enabled>
    <management-enabled>true</management-enabled>
    <eviction size="10000" max-size-policy="ENTRY_COUNT" eviction-policy="LRU" />
</cache>
----

NOTE: To track the cache statistics on Hazelcast Management Center, you have to enable the statistics
(disabled by default) for the cache configuration of the Hazelcast instance.

NOTE: If client mode is used, cache configurations must be set on the server configuration (`hazelcast.xml`), not on the client-side (`hazelcast-client.xml`).

TIP: If you do not define a specific region name, the default cache configuration is going to be
used. Hence it will not be visible on Hazelcast Management Center. To apply
a config to all regions, you can use a wildcard for `name` property (e.g., `name="*"`).

For other cache configuration properties, see cache configuration section on the documentation
https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#icache-configuration[here].
Eviction size and policy properties might be useful for this case.


== Summary

We've configured an application to use Hibernate's Second-Level cache with Hazelcast.

You can find the code samples for entity cache, collection cache, and query cache use cases {github-address}[here.]
